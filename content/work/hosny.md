intro:
    - "HOSNY is a participative agent-based simulation built to speculate alternative economies. It asks how world-building as interactive gameplay creates the opportunity for a better and more complete understanding of the complex relationships that make up the systems of our world."
    - "Players set a virtual model of New York with simulated citizens, built using data based on the U.S. Census and agent-based modeling, according to their preferences of how the world should function. They are then assigned a character from this simulated pool and given the chance to steer the future of the city through a simple democracy: players take turns voting on important issues at the end of each play session."

# Humans of Simulated New York

# Generating a city

We generated "plausible" simulated citizens from a model learned from New York City American Community Survey (ACS) data spanning 2005-2014.
