# What is PSA?

Experiments and explorations into algorithms, AI, simulations, and society. Making the invisible algorithms and systems that run the world more visible, intuitive, and accessible.

We build simulations as thought experiments, and through our tools we can help you understand the systems you have and help you imagine new ones.

We are a co-op. We aim for our work to make a more just world, and that work includes PSA itself. Everyone in PSA is an owner and we've designed processes to facilitate democratic and consensus-based decision making.
