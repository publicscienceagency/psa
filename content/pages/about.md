# What is PSA?

Experiments and explorations into algorithms, AI, simulations, and society. Making the invisible algorithms and systems that run the world more visible, intuitive, and accessible.

We are a co-op. We aim for our work to make a more just world, and that work includes PSA itself. Everyone in PSA is an owner and we've designed processes to facilitate democratic and consensus-based decision making.
